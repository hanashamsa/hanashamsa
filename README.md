# 👋 Hi, I’m Hanas

I’m an **AI Engineer and MSc Artificial Intelligence student** with a strong focus on **Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and reliable AI systems**. My work sits at the intersection of applied machine learning, AI research, and real-world system design.

I enjoy building **end-to-end AI solutions** — from data and modeling to evaluation, uncertainty estimation, and deployment — with an emphasis on robustness, interpretability, and practical impact.

## 🔬 What I’m currently working on

* **White-Box Uncertainty Quantification for LLM Generation**
  Interpretable uncertainty signals for RAG systems, trust scoring, and hallucination detection.
* **Multimodal RAG Pipelines**
  Combining text and vision embeddings for grounded, reliable generation.
* **REOBench**
  Benchmarking robustness of Earth Observation foundation models under distribution shifts.
* Applied projects in **LLMs, AI safety, and evaluation-focused ML systems**.
